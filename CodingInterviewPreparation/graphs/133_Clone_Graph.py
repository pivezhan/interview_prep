# Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

# Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

# Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

# class Node {
#     public int val;
#     public List<Node> neighbors;
# }
 

# Test case format:

# For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

# An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

# The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
# 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
# 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
